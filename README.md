Effective Date:

### Introduction
Evoke respects your privacy. This policy outlines how we handle your personal data and media. We are committed to protecting your information and ensuring transparency about how it is managed.

### 1. Information We Collect
Evoke collects no personal information. All data and media are stored locally on your device or within your iCloud account if you choose to enable iCloud storage. The only exception is subscription management through RevenueCat, which monitors your subscription status.

### 2. Third-Party Services
We use RevenueCat to manage subscriptions. All payment information is handled by the App Store, and we do not collect or have access to any payment details beyond an indentifier to connect you to your purchase history. For more information on RevenueCat’s data practices, please refer to their [Privacy Policy](https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy/).

### 3. Data Storage and Security
Evoke stores all data on your device or in your iCloud account if iCloud storage is enabled. We do not store or access this data on external servers. While we strive to protect your data, please ensure your iCloud account and device are secure.

### 4. Children's Privacy
Evoke is designed for a general audience and is not directed towards children. We do not knowingly collect any personal data, including from users under the age of 13.

### 5. User Media
Evoke accesses the media files you import (e.g., images, videos) for creating presentations. These files are stored either on your device or in your iCloud account, depending on your settings, and are not shared outside the app.

### 6. Payments
All subscription payments are handled through the App Store. Evoke does not store or process any payment information. For more information, please refer to Apple’s privacy policy and terms.

If you have a question about this privacy and how your data are collected, used and stored when you use Spatial Effects, please feel free to email me at support [at] choircreator.com with the subject line “Evoke - Data Question” and let me know how we can help you.
